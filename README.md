# Plane Crash Safety Machine Learning

This project uses a historical dataset documenting plane crashes and applies a series of ML techniques to explore and model the data.

The project contains:
* `Executive Summary.pdf` - a report outlining the models developed and the results from these
* `Presentation.pdf` - slides to support presentation of the results generated
* `Plane Crashes.csv` - a csv file containing historical planne crash data, source: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data)
* `all_code.py` - all the models developed
* `text.txt` - the columns found in the modified dataset
